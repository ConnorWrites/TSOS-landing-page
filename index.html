      <p class="m">This book tells the story of a boy discovering a world lying just beyond the edge of perception. His insatiable curiosity leads him on his journey, and takes him on a fantastic adventure where he discovers the wonders of the realm in much the same way one discovers the ground upon falling from a tree.

William is a boy who loves stories. Stories fill his dreams, spark his imagination, and fuel his creativity, yet he’s always wondered how it all works and how it’s connected.

One night, William jolts up as loud, crashing thunder of a strange storm rages over the town. He rushes to close his window, but sees a mysterious figure standing outside in the dark as lightning dances through the night sky. Terror grips him as it turns to face him, and he stands frozen in the otherworldly glow of the eyes of the creature.</p>

      <header class="more-books"><em>The Tavern of Forbidden Tales</em></header>
        <p class="m">There is a pub where workers go for a drink after work every day, and above its door there is a weathered sign which once proudly showcased a name that has long since been forgotten. Instead, the pub is known by another name, shrouded in mystery.

Its regular customers, known as Gumplegruffs, work at the factory where the story scrolls are made, and whispers of stories that threaten to upset or even destroy the natural balance of the universe, often make their way into the beloved pub, now known as the Tavern of Forbidden Tales.

All stories on this page come from that peculiar tavern.</p>

      <header class="more-books"><em>The Eco Friendly Monster - Coming soon!</em></header>
      <p class="m">A Monster tries to be eco-friendly but can’t succeed because no matter how hard she tries to live environmentally friendly it seems impossible to keep the environment clean. While going fishing using an environmentally friendly tool which produced a ton of trash, she sees a turtle choking on something that looks like trash she threw out, and becomes sad at the state of the world. After that, a little bunny friend comes to visit her and sees that she’s sad so he suggests to live off her garden rather than buying stuff and supporting big corporations that don’t seem to care about the environment.

The monster then becomes very good at sustainable gardening, and influences all of her friends to work together to make a difference, and ends up impacting the whole city.</p>
